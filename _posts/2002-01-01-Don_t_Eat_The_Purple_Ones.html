<h2>Don&apos;t Eat The Purple Ones </h2>
<p>The PCs are stranded in a strange place, and must survive by
  finding food and shelter, and then worry about getting back
  home.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs must survive only
  for a short period of time, until help arrives, the ship and/or
  radio is repaired, or some such thing (in &quot;repair&quot;
  scenarios, sometimes the PCs must discover some fact about
  the local environment that will make such repairs possible).
