<h2>Long Or Short Fork When Dining On Elf? </h2>
<p>The PCs are a diplomatic vanguard, trying to open up (or shore
  up) either political or trade relations with a strange culture.
  All they have to do is manage for a day or so among the strange
  customs without offending anybody . . . and what information
  they have is both incomplete and dangerously misleading.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs were chosen by somebody
  who knew they weren&apos;t prepared for it - an NPC trying
  to sabotage the works (pinning this villain might be necessary
  to avert disaster). </p>
