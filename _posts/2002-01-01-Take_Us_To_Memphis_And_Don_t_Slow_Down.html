<h2>Take Us To Memphis And Don&apos;t Slow Down </h2>
<p>The PCs are on board a populated conveyance (East Indiaman, Cruise
  Ship, Ferry, Sleeper Starship), when it is hijacked. The PCs
  must take action while the normals sit and twiddle.</p>
<p>
  <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The &quot;hijackers&quot;
  are government agents pulling a complicated caper, forcing
  the PCs to choose sides. The hijackers don&apos;t realize there
  is a secondary danger that must be dealt with, and any attempt
  to convince them is viewed as a trick. The normals are unhelpful
  or even hostile to the PCs because they think the PCs are just
  making matters worse. </p>
