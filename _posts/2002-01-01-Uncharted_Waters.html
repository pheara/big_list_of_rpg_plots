<h2>Uncharted Waters </h2>
<p>The PCs are explorers, and their goal is to enter an unknown
  territory and scope it out. Naturally, the job isn&apos;t just
  going to be surveying and drawing sketches of local fauna;
  something is there, something fascinating and threatening.
  </p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>Either the place itself
  is threatening (in which case the PCs must both play National
  Geographic and simultaneously try to escape with their skin,
  sanity, and credit rating) or the place itself is very valuable
  and wonderful, and something <em>else </em>there is keen on
  making sure the PCs don&apos;t let anyone else know. Other
  potential conflicts involve damage to the PCs&apos; conveyance
  or communication equipment, in which case this becomes Don&apos;t
  Eat the Purple Ones. </p>
