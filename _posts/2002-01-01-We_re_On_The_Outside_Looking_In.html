<h2>We&apos;re On The Outside Looking In </h2>
<p>Any of the basic plots in this list can be reengineered with
  the PCs on the outside of it. Either the PCs are accompanying
  other characters in the midst of such a plot (often being called
  on to defend the plot from the outside, as it were), or they
  are minding their own business when the others involved in
  the plot show up, and must pick sides or simply resist. For
  instance, with Any Old Port In The Storm, the PCs could already
  be enjoying (or native to) the shelter when a strange group
  arrives. If the &quot;the PCs are unwelcome&quot; variant is
  employed, then perhaps the PCs will be the only voice of reason
  to still the religious fervor, racial prejudice, anti-monster
  sentiment, or whatever else is the source of conflict. </p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs find themselves
  on the receiving end of the adventure. Take any of the plots
  here and reverse them, placing the PCs in the position where
  NPCs (often the villain, fugitive, etcetera) normally are.
  Instead of hunting, they must be hunted. Instead of fixing,
  they must avoid getting &quot;fixed&quot; themselves (ow).
  Alternately, leave a classic plot intact but turn the <em>twists </em>upside
  down, making them twistier (or refreshingly <em>un </em>twisty).
