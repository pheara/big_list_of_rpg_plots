<h2>I Beg Your Pardon? </h2>
<p>The PCs are minding their own business when they are attacked
  or threatened. They don&apos;t know why. They must solve the
  mystery of their attacker&apos;s motives, and in the meantime
  fend off more attacks. They must put two and two together to
  deal with the problem.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs have something that
  the bad guys want - but they don&apos;t necessarily realize
  it. The bad guys are out for revenge for a dead compatriot
  from a previous adventure. The bad guys have mistaken the PCs
  for somebody else. </p>
