<h1>Any Old Port in a Storm</h1>
<p>The PCs are seeking shelter from the elements or some other threat,
  and come across a place to hole up. They find that they have
  stumbled across something dangerous, secret, or supernatural,
  and must then deal with it in order to enjoy a little rest.
  </p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The shelter contains the
  cause of the threat the PCs were trying to avoid. The shelter
  houses a Hidden Base (q.v.). The PCs must not only struggle
  for shelter, they must struggle to survive. The place <em>is </em>a
  legitimate shelter of some kind, but the PCs are not welcome,
  and must win hearts or minds to earn their bed for the night.
