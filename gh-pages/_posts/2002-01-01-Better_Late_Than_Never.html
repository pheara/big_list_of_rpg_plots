<h1>Better Late Than Never </h1>
<p>Some bad guys have arrived and done some bad guy things. The
  PCs were none the wiser. The bad guys have now made good their
  escape, and the PCs have caught wind of it in time to chase
  them down before they make it back to their lair, their home
  nation, behind enemy lines, etc. </p>
<p><em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The bad guys escaped by
  stealing a conveyance that the PCs know better than they do.
  The bad guys duck down a metaphorical (or literal) side-road,
  trying to hide or blend into an environment (often one hostile
  to the PCs). If the bad guys cross the adventure&apos;s &quot;finish
  line&quot; (cross the county line, make the warp jump, etc.)
  there&apos;s no way to pursue them beyond it. </p>
