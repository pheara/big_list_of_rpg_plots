<h1 class="trope-heading">Blackmail </h1>
<p>Usually through trickery (but sometimes by digging into the PCs&apos;
  past), an antagonist has something to hold over the heads of
  the PCs and make them jump. This could be any kind of threat
  from physical to social, but it depends on the villain having
  something - even if it&apos;s information - that others don&apos;t
  have. Now, he is pulling the strings of the PCs, telling them
  to do things they don&apos;t want to. The PCs must end the
  cycle of blackmail, deprive the villain of his edge, and keep
  him temporarily satisfied while doing it.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The adventure hook involves
  the PCs doing the villain a good turn, which allows him to
  take advantage of them (very cynical!). To succeed, the PCs
  must contact other folks that are also being used. The PCs
  aren&apos;t the victims at all, but somebody they care about/are
  charged to protect, is. </p>
