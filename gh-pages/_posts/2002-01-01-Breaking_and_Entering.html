<h1>Breaking and Entering </h1>
<p>Mission objective: enter the dangerous place, and retrieve the
  vital dingus or valuable person. Overcome the area&apos;s defenses
  to do so.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The goal is not to extract
  a thing, but to destroy a thing or interfere with a process
  (kill the force-screen generator, assassinate the evil king,
  stop the spell from being cast, wreck the invasion plans, close
  the portal). The goal has moved. The goal is information, which
  must be broadcast or otherwise released from the area as soon
  as it is found. The job must be done without alerting anyone.
  The PCs don&apos;t know the place is dangerous. The PCs must
  replace the thing with another thing. </p>
