<h1>Capture the Flag </h1>
<p>The PCs must secure a military target for the good guys. There
  are bad guys there that prefer <em>not </em>to be secured.
  The fundamental tactical scenario.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs must assemble and/or
  train a force to do the job with them. The PCs are working
  with flawed intelligence and the target zone isn&apos;t as
  described. The PCs must coordinate their own efforts with an
  ally group (possibly putting aside rivalries to do so). The
  target zone includes a population of innocent people, fragile
  goods, or some other precious thing that mustn&apos;t be harmed
  in the crossfire. </p>
