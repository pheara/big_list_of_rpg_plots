<h1>Delver&apos;s Delight </h1>
<p>The PCs are treasure-hunters, who have caught wind of a treasure-laden
  ruin. They go to explore it, and must deal with its supernatural
  denizens to win the treasure and get out alive.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The treasure itself is something
  dangerous. The treasure isn&apos;t in a ruin, but in a wilderness
  or even hidden somewhere &quot;civilized.&quot; The treasure
  is someone else&apos;s rightful property. The treasure turns
  out to have a will of its own. </p>
