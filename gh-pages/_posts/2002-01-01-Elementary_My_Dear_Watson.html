<h1>Elementary, My Dear Watson </h1>
<p>A crime or atrocity has been committed; the PCs must solve it.
  They must interview witnesses (and prevent them from being
  killed), gather clues (and prevent them from being stolen or
  ruined). They must then assemble proof to deliver to the authorities,
  or serve as personal ministers of justice.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs are working to clear
  an innocent already accused (possibly themselves). The PCs
  must work alongside a special investigator or are otherwise
  saddled with an unwanted ally. Midway through the adventure,
  the PCs are &quot;taken off the case&quot; - their invitation/authority
  to pursue the matter is closed (often the result of political
  maneuvering by an antagonist). The climax is a courtroom scene
  or other arena of judgment. The scale is highly variable for
  this type of adventure, from a small-town murder to a planetwide
  pollution scandal. </p>
