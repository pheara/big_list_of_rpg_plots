<h1>Escort Service </h1>
<p>The PCs have a valuable object or person, which needs to be taken
  to a safe place or to its rightful owner, etc. They must undertake
  a dangerous journey in which one or more factions (and chance
  and misfortune) try to deprive them of the thing in their care.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The thing or person is troublesome,
  and tries to escape or sidetrack the PCs. The destination has
  been destroyed or suborned by the enemy, and the PCs must take
  upon themselves the job that either the destination or their
  charge was meant to do when it got there. The person is a person
  attempting a political defection. Safe arrival at the destination
  doesn&apos;t end the story; the PCs must then bargain with
  their charge as their token (exchanging money for a hostage,
  for instance). The PCs must protect the target without the
  target <em>knowing </em>about it. </p>
