<h1>Help is on the Way </h1>
<p>A person (church group, nation, galaxy) is in a hazardous situation
  they can&apos;t survive without rescue. The PCs are on the
  job. In some scenarios, the hook is as simple as a distant
  yell or crackly distress signal.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The victim(s) is (are) a
  hostage, or under siege from enemy forces, and the PCs must
  deal with the captors or break the siege. There is a danger
  that any rescue attempts will strand the rescuers in the same
  soup as the rescuees, compounding the problem. The rescuees
  aren&apos;t people, but animals, robots, or something else.
  The &quot;victim&quot; doesn&apos;t realize that he needs rescuing;
  he thinks he&apos;s doing something reasonable and/or safe.
  The threat isn&apos;t villain-oriented at all; it&apos;s a
  natural disaster, nuclear meltdown, or disease outbreak. The
  rescuees <em>can&apos;t leave </em>; something immobile and
  vital must be tended to or dealt with at the adventure location.
  The PCs begin as part of the rescuees, and must escape and
  gather forces or resources to bring back and proceed as above.
