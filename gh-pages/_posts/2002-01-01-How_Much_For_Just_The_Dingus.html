<h1>How Much For Just The Dingus? </h1>
<p>Within a defined area, something important and valuable exists.
  The PCs (or their employers) want it, but so do one or more
  other groups. The ones that get it will be the ones that can
  outthink and outrace the others, deal best with the natives
  of the area, and learn the most about their target. Each competing
  group has its own agenda and resources. </p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The natives require the
  competing factions to gather before them as pals to state their
  cases. The valuable thing was en route somewhere when its conveyance
  or courier wrecked or vanished. </p>
