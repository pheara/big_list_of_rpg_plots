<h1>Look, Don&apos;t Touch </h1>
<p>The PCs are working surveillance - spying on a person, gathering
  information on a beast in the wild, scouting a new sector.
  Regardless of the scale, the primary conflict (at least at
  the start) is the rule that they are <em>only </em>to watch,
  listen and learn. They are not to make contact or let themselves
  be known.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The target gets itself in
  trouble and the PCs must decide whether to break the no-contact
  rule in order to mount a rescue. </p>
