<h1>Manhunt </h1>
<p>Someone is gone: they&apos;ve run away, gotten lost, or simply
  haven&apos;t called home in a while. Somebody misses them or
  needs them returned. The PCs are called in to find them and
  bring them back.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The target has been kidnapped
  (possibly to specifically lure the PCs). The target is dangerous
  and escaped from a facility designed to protect the public.
  The target is valuable and escaped from a place designed to
  keep him safe, cozy, and conveniently handy. The target has
  a reason for leaving that the PCs will sympathize with. The
  target has stumbled across another adventure (either as protagonist
  or victim), which the PCs must then undertake themselves. The
  missing &quot;person&quot; is an entire expedition or pilgrimage
  of some kind. The target isn&apos;t a runaway <em>or </em>missing/lost
  - they&apos;re just someone that the PCs have been hired to
  track down (possibly under false pretenses). </p>
