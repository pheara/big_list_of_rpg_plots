<h1>Missing Memories </h1>
<p>One or more of the PCs wakes up with no memory of the recent
  past, and now they find themselves in some kind of trouble
  they don&apos;t understand. The PCs must find the reason for
  the memory lapse, and solve any problems they uncover in the
  meantime.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The forgetful PCs voluntarily
  suppressed or erased the memories, and they find themselves
  undoing their own work. </p>
<h1>Most Peculiar, Momma </h1>
<p>Something both bad and inexplicable is happening (racial tension
  is being fired up in town, all the power is out, the beer supply
  is drained, it&apos;s snowing in July, <em>Voyager </em>still
  has fans, hordes of aliens are eating all the cheese), and
  a lot of people are very troubled by it. The PCs must track
  the phenomenon to its source, and stop it.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs are somehow unwittingly
  responsible for the whole thing. What seems to be a problem
  of one nature (technological, personal, biological, chemical,
  magical, political, etc) is actually a problem of an alternate
  one. </p>
