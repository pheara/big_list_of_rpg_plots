<h1>No One Has Soiled The Bridge </h1>
<p>The PCs are assigned to guard a single vital spot (anything from
  a mountain pass to a solar system) from impending or possible
  attack. They must plan their defensive strategy, set up watches,
  set traps, and so on, and then deal with the enemy when it
  arrives.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The intelligence the PCs
  was given turns out to be faulty, but acting on the new information
  could result in greater danger - but so could <em>not </em>acting
  on it, and the PCs must choose or create a compromise. The
  PCs learn that the enemy has good and sympathetic reason for
  wanting to destroy the protected spot. </p>
