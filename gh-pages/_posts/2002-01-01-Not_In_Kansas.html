<h1>Not In Kansas </h1>
<p>The PCs are minding their own business and find themselves transported
  to a strange place. They must figure out where they are, why
  they are there and how to escape.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>They were brought there
  specifically to help someone in trouble. They were brought
  there by accident, as a by-product of something strange and
  secret. Some of the PCs&apos; enemies were transported along
  with them (or separately), and now they have a new battleground,
  and innocents to convince which guys are the good guys. </p>
