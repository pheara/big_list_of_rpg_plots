<h1>Ounces of Prevention </h1>
<p>A villain or organization is getting ready to do something bad,
  and the PCs have received a tip-off of some sort. They must
  investigate to find out more about the caper, and then act
  to prevent it.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The initial tip-off was
  a red herring meant to distract the PCs from the actual caper.
  There are two simultaneous Bad Things on the way, and no apparent
  way to both of them - how to choose? </p>
