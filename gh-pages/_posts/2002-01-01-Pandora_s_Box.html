<h1>Pandora&apos;s Box </h1>
<p>Somebody has tinkered with Things Man Ought Not, or opened a
  portal to the Mean People Dimension, cracked a wall at the
  state prison, or summoned an ancient Babylonian god into a
  penthouse. Before the PCs can even think of confronting the
  source of the trouble, they must deal with the waves of trouble
  already released by it: monsters, old foes out for vengeance,
  curious aliens who think cars/citizens/McDonald&apos;s hamburgers
  resemble food, and so forth.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs can&apos;t simply
  take the released badness to the mat; they have to collect
  it and shove it back into the source before it the adventure
  can really end. The PCs are drawn in to the source and must
  solve problems on the other side before returning to this one.
  A secret book, code, or other rare element is necessary to
  plug the breach (maybe just the fellow who opened it). A close
  cousin to this plot is the basic &quot;somebody has traveled
  into the past and messed with our reality&quot; story. </p>
