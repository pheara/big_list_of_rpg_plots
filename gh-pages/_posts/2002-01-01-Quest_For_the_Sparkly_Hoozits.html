<h1>Quest For the Sparkly Hoozits </h1>
<p>Somebody needs a dingus (to fulfill a prophecy, heal the monarch,
  prevent a war, cure a disease, or what have you). The PCs must
  find a dingus. Often an old dingus, a mysterious dingus, and
  a powerful dingus. The PCs must learn more about it to track
  it down, and then deal with taking it from wherever it is.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The dingus is incomplete
  when found (one of the most irritating and un-fun plot twists
  in the universe). Somebody already owns it (or recently stole
  it, sometimes with legitimate claim or cause). The dingus is
  information, or an idea, or a substance, not a specific dingus.
  The PCs must &quot;go undercover&quot; or otherwise infiltrate
  a group or society, gaining the dingus by guile or stealth.
