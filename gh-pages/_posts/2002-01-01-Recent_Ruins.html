<h1>Recent Ruins </h1>
<p>A town, castle, starship, outpost, or other civilized construct
  is lying in ruins. Very recently, it was just dandy. The PCs
  must enter the ruins, explore them, and find out what happened.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>Whatever ruined the ruins
  (including mean people, weird radiation, monsters, a new race,
  ghosts) is still a threat; the PCs must save the day. The inhabitants
  destroyed themselves. The &quot;ruins&quot; are a derelict
  ship or spaceship, recently discovered. The &quot;ruin&quot;
  is a ghost town, stumbled across as the PCs travel - but the
  map says the town is alive and well. </p>
