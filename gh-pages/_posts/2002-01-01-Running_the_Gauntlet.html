<h1>Running the Gauntlet </h1>
<p>The PCs must travel through a hazardous area, and get through
  without being killed, robbed, humiliated, debased, diseased,
  or educated by whatever is there. The troubles they encounter
  are rarely personal in nature - the place <em>itself </em>is
  the &quot;villain&quot; of the adventure. </p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The place isn&apos;t dangerous
  at all, and the various &quot;dangers&quot; are actually attempts
  to communicate with the party by some agent or another. </p>
