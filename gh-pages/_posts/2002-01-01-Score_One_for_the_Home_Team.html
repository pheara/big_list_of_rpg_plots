<h1>Score One for the Home Team </h1>
<p>The PCs are participants in a race, contest, tournament, scavenger
  hunt or other voluntary bit of sport. They must win.</p>
<p>
  <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The other contestants
  are less honest, and the PCs must overcome their attempts to
  win dishonestly. The PCs are competing for a deeper purpose
  than victory, such as to keep another contestant safe, or spy
  on one, or just to get into the place where the event goes
  down. The PCs don&apos;t wish to win; they just wish to prevent
  the villain from winning. The event is a deliberate test of
  the PCs abilities (for entry into an organization, for example).
  The event becomes more deadly than it&apos;s supposed to. </p>
