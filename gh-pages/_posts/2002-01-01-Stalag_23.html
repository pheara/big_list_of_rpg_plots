<h1>Stalag 23 </h1>
<p>The PCs are imprisoned, and must engineer an escape, overcoming
  any guards, automatic measures, and geographic isolation their
  prison imposes on them.</p>
<p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>Something has happened in
  the outside world and the prison security has fallen lax because
  of it. The PCs have been hired to &quot;test&quot; the prison
  - they aren&apos;t normal inmates. Other prisoners decide to
  blow the whistle for spite or revenge. The PCs are undercover
  to spy on a prisoner, but are then mistaken for real inmates
  and kept incarcerated. The PCs must escape on a tight schedule
  to get to another adventure outside the walls. </p>
