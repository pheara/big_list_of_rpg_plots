<h1>Troublemakers </h1>
<p>A bad guy (or a group of them, or multiple parties) is kicking
  up a ruckus, upsetting the neighbors, poisoning the reservoirs,
  or otherwise causing trouble. The PCs have to go where the
  trouble is, locate the bad guys, and stop the party.</p>
<p>
  <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs must not harm
  the perpetrator(s); they must be bagged alive and well. The
  bad guys have prepared something dangerous and hidden as &quot;insurance&quot;
  if they are captured. The &quot;bad guy&quot; is a monster
  or dangerous animal (or an intelligent creature that everybody
  thinks is a monster or animal). The &quot;bad guy&quot; is
  a respected public figure, superior officer, or someone else
  abusing their authority, and the PCs might meet hostility from
  normally-helpful quarters who don&apos;t accept that the bad
  guy is bad. A balance of power perpetuates the trouble, and
  the PCs must choose sides to tip the balance and fix things.
  The &quot;trouble&quot; is diplomatic or political, and the
  PCs must make peace, not war. </p>
