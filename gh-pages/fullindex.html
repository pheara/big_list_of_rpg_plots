</p>

What follows is a scrap of trivia . . . my collection
of <em>RPG plots</em>, in abstract form. I built this by examining
the premises of hundreds of published adventures for all systems (including
those systems dear and departed from print), trying to boil them down to
common denominators. The results are presented here: arbitrary, and sometimes
redundant. Nevertheless, I turn to this list when I'm stuck for a fresh
premise for next week's session of my campaign, whatever that campaign
might happen to be about at the time. It helps me keep from falling into
thematic ruts (my least favorite kind). With any luck, it might serve a
similar function for you.
<p><em>Note: </em>The "plots" are arranged in alphabetical
order by title. Since the titles are arbitrary, this serves no useful function
at all. And if you want <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023309/http://www.kysu.edu/artsscience/ENG411/5act.htm">shakespearean

<section>
  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Any Old Port in a Storm</h1>

    <p>The PCs are seeking shelter from the elements or some
    other threat, and come across a place to hole up. They find that they have
    stumbled across something dangerous, secret, or supernatural, and must
    then deal with it in order to enjoy a little rest. </p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The shelter contains the cause of the threat the PCs were
    trying to avoid. The shelter houses a Hidden Base (q.v.). The PCs must
    not only struggle for shelter, they must struggle to survive. The place
    <em>is </em>a legitimate shelter of some kind, but the PCs are not welcome,
    and must win hearts or minds to earn their bed for the night. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Better Late Than Never </h1>

    <p>Some bad guys have arrived and done some bad guy things.
    The PCs were none the wiser. The bad guys have now made good their escape,
    and the PCs have caught wind of it in time to chase them down before they
    make it back to their lair, their home nation, behind enemy lines, etc.
    </p>
    <p><em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The bad guys escaped by stealing a conveyance that the PCs
    know better than they do. The bad guys duck down a metaphorical (or literal)
    side-road, trying to hide or blend into an environment (often one hostile
    to the PCs). If the bad guys cross the adventure's "finish line"
    (cross the county line, make the warp jump, etc.) there's no way to pursue
    them beyond it. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1 class="trope-heading">Blackmail </h1>

    <p>Usually through trickery (but sometimes by digging into
    the PCs' past), an antagonist has something to hold over the heads of the
    PCs and make them jump. This could be any kind of threat from physical
    to social, but it depends on the villain having something - even if it's
    information - that others don't have. Now, he is pulling the strings of
    the PCs, telling them to do things they don't want to. The PCs must end
    the cycle of blackmail, deprive the villain of his edge, and keep him temporarily
    satisfied while doing it.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The adventure hook involves the PCs doing the villain a
    good turn, which allows him to take advantage of them (very cynical!).
    To succeed, the PCs must contact other folks that are also being used.
    The PCs aren't the victims at all, but somebody they care about/are charged
    to protect, is. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Breaking and Entering </h1>

    <p>Mission objective: enter the dangerous place, and retrieve
    the vital dingus or valuable person. Overcome the area's defenses to do
    so.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The goal is not to extract a thing, but to destroy a thing
    or interfere with a process (kill the force-screen generator, assassinate
    the evil king, stop the spell from being cast, wreck the invasion plans,
    close the portal). The goal has moved. The goal is information, which must
    be broadcast or otherwise released from the area as soon as it is found.
    The job must be done without alerting anyone. The PCs don't know the place
    is dangerous. The PCs must replace the thing with another thing. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Capture the Flag </h1>

    <p>The PCs must secure a military target for the good guys.
    There are bad guys there that prefer <em>not </em>to be secured. The fundamental
    tactical scenario.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs must assemble and/or train a force to do the job
    with them. The PCs are working with flawed intelligence and the target
    zone isn't as described. The PCs must coordinate their own efforts with
    an ally group (possibly putting aside rivalries to do so). The target zone
    includes a population of innocent people, fragile goods, or some other
    precious thing that mustn't be harmed in the crossfire. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Clearing The Hex </h1>

    <p>There is a place where bad things live. The PCs must make
    it safe for nice people, systematically clearing it of danger.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The bad things can't be beaten with direct conflict. The
    PCs must learn more about them to solve the problem. The Haunted House.
    The Alien Infestation. The Wild Forest. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Delver's Delight </h1>

    <p>The PCs are treasure-hunters, who have caught wind of
    a treasure-laden ruin. They go to explore it, and must deal with its supernatural
    denizens to win the treasure and get out alive.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The treasure itself is something dangerous. The treasure
    isn't in a ruin, but in a wilderness or even hidden somewhere "civilized."
    The treasure is someone else's rightful property. The treasure turns out
    to have a will of its own. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Don't Eat The Purple Ones </h1>

    <p>The PCs are stranded in a strange place, and must survive
    by finding food and shelter, and then worry about getting back home.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs must survive only for a short period of time, until
    help arrives, the ship and/or radio is repaired, or some such thing (in
    "repair" scenarios, sometimes the PCs must discover some fact
    about the local environment that will make such repairs possible). </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Elementary, My Dear Watson </h1>

    <p>A crime or atrocity has been committed; the PCs must solve
    it. They must interview witnesses (and prevent them from being killed),
    gather clues (and prevent them from being stolen or ruined). They must
    then assemble proof to deliver to the authorities, or serve as personal
    ministers of justice.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs are working to clear an innocent already accused
    (possibly themselves). The PCs must work alongside a special investigator
    or are otherwise saddled with an unwanted ally. Midway through the adventure,
    the PCs are "taken off the case" - their invitation/authority
    to pursue the matter is closed (often the result of political maneuvering
    by an antagonist). The climax is a courtroom scene or other arena of judgment.
    The scale is highly variable for this type of adventure, from a small-town
    murder to a planetwide pollution scandal. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Escort Service </h1>

    <p>The PCs have a valuable object or person, which needs
    to be taken to a safe place or to its rightful owner, etc. They must undertake
    a dangerous journey in which one or more factions (and chance and misfortune)
    try to deprive them of the thing in their care.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The thing or person is troublesome, and tries to escape
    or sidetrack the PCs. The destination has been destroyed or suborned by
    the enemy, and the PCs must take upon themselves the job that either the
    destination or their charge was meant to do when it got there. The person
    is a person attempting a political defection. Safe arrival at the destination
    doesn't end the story; the PCs must then bargain with their charge as their
    token (exchanging money for a hostage, for instance). The PCs must protect
    the target without the target <em>knowing </em>about it. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Good Housekeeping </h1>

    <p>The PCs are placed in charge of a large operation (a trading
    company, a feudal barony, the CIA) and must, despite lack of experience
    in such things, make it work and thrive.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs are brought in because something big is about to
    happen, and the Old Guard wants a chance to escape. The peasants, neighbors,
    employees, etcetera resent the PCs, because their method of inheritance
    looks outwardly bad and everybody loved the old boss. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Help is on the Way </h1>

    <p>A person (church group, nation, galaxy) is in a hazardous
    situation they can't survive without rescue. The PCs are on the job. In
    some scenarios, the hook is as simple as a distant yell or crackly distress
    signal.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The victim(s) is (are) a hostage, or under siege from enemy
    forces, and the PCs must deal with the captors or break the siege. There
    is a danger that any rescue attempts will strand the rescuers in the same
    soup as the rescuees, compounding the problem. The rescuees aren't people,
    but animals, robots, or something else. The "victim" doesn't
    realize that he needs rescuing; he thinks he's doing something reasonable
    and/or safe. The threat isn't villain-oriented at all; it's a natural disaster,
    nuclear meltdown, or disease outbreak. The rescuees <em>can't leave </em>;
    something immobile and vital must be tended to or dealt with at the adventure
    location. The PCs begin as part of the rescuees, and must escape and gather
    forces or resources to bring back and proceed as above. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Hidden Base </h1>

    <p>The PCs, while traveling or exploring, come across a hornet's
    nest of bad guys, preparing for Big Badness. They must either find some
    way to get word to the good guys, or sneak in and disable the place themselves,
    or a combination of both.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs must figure out how to use local resources in order
    to defend themselves or have a chance against the inhabitants. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>How Much For Just The Dingus? </h1>

    <p>Within a defined area, something important and valuable
    exists. The PCs (or their employers) want it, but so do one or more other
    groups. The ones that get it will be the ones that can outthink and outrace
    the others, deal best with the natives of the area, and learn the most
    about their target. Each competing group has its own agenda and resources.
    </p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The natives require the competing factions to gather before
    them as pals to state their cases. The valuable thing was en route somewhere
    when its conveyance or courier wrecked or vanished. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>I Beg Your Pardon? </h1>

    <p>The PCs are minding their own business when they are attacked
    or threatened. They don't know why. They must solve the mystery of their
    attacker's motives, and in the meantime fend off more attacks. They must
    put two and two together to deal with the problem.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs have something that the bad guys want - but they
    don't necessarily realize it. The bad guys are out for revenge for a dead
    compatriot from a previous adventure. The bad guys have mistaken the PCs
    for somebody else. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Long Or Short Fork When Dining On
    Elf? </h1>

    <p>The PCs are a diplomatic vanguard, trying to open up (or
    shore up) either political or trade relations with a strange culture. All
    they have to do is manage for a day or so among the strange customs without
    offending anybody . . . and what information they have is both incomplete
    and dangerously misleading.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs were chosen by somebody who knew they weren't prepared
    for it - an NPC trying to sabotage the works (pinning this villain might
    be necessary to avert disaster). </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Look, Don't Touch </h1>

    <p>The PCs are working surveillance - spying on a person,
    gathering information on a beast in the wild, scouting a new sector. Regardless
    of the scale, the primary conflict (at least at the start) is the rule
    that they are <em>only </em>to watch, listen and learn. They are not to make
    contact or let themselves be known.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The target gets itself in trouble and the PCs must decide
    whether to break the no-contact rule in order to mount a rescue. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Manhunt </h1>

    <p>Someone is gone: they've run away, gotten lost, or simply
    haven't called home in a while. Somebody misses them or needs them returned.
    The PCs are called in to find them and bring them back.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The target has been kidnapped (possibly to specifically
    lure the PCs). The target is dangerous and escaped from a facility designed
    to protect the public. The target is valuable and escaped from a place
    designed to keep him safe, cozy, and conveniently handy. The target has
    a reason for leaving that the PCs will sympathize with. The target has
    stumbled across another adventure (either as protagonist or victim), which
    the PCs must then undertake themselves. The missing "person"
    is an entire expedition or pilgrimage of some kind. The target isn't a
    runaway <em>or </em>missing/lost - they're just someone that the PCs have
    been hired to track down (possibly under false pretenses). </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Missing Memories </h1>

    <p>One or more of the PCs wakes up with no memory of the
    recent past, and now they find themselves in some kind of trouble they
    don't understand. The PCs must find the reason for the memory lapse, and
    solve any problems they uncover in the meantime.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The forgetful PCs voluntarily suppressed or erased the memories,
    and they find themselves undoing their own work. </p>

    <h1>Most Peculiar, Momma </h1>

    <p>Something both bad and inexplicable is happening (racial
    tension is being fired up in town, all the power is out, the beer supply
    is drained, it's snowing in July, <em>Voyager </em>still has fans, hordes
    of aliens are eating all the cheese), and a lot of people are very troubled
    by it. The PCs must track the phenomenon to its source, and stop it.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs are somehow unwittingly responsible for the whole
    thing. What seems to be a problem of one nature (technological, personal,
    biological, chemical, magical, political, etc) is actually a problem of
    an alternate one. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>No One Has Soiled The Bridge </h1>

    <p>The PCs are assigned to guard a single vital spot (anything
    from a mountain pass to a solar system) from impending or possible attack.
    They must plan their defensive strategy, set up watches, set traps, and
    so on, and then deal with the enemy when it arrives.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The intelligence the PCs was given turns out to be faulty,
    but acting on the new information could result in greater danger - but
    so could <em>not </em>acting on it, and the PCs must choose or create a compromise.
    The PCs learn that the enemy has good and sympathetic reason for wanting
    to destroy the protected spot. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Not In Kansas </h1>

    <p>The PCs are minding their own business and find themselves
    transported to a strange place. They must figure out where they are, why
    they are there and how to escape.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>They were brought there specifically to help someone in
    trouble. They were brought there by accident, as a by-product of something
    strange and secret. Some of the PCs' enemies were transported along with
    them (or separately), and now they have a new battleground, and innocents
    to convince which guys are the good guys. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Ounces of Prevention </h1>

    <p>A villain or organization is getting ready to do something
    bad, and the PCs have received a tip-off of some sort. They must investigate
    to find out more about the caper, and then act to prevent it.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The initial tip-off was a red herring meant to distract
    the PCs from the actual caper. There are two simultaneous Bad Things on
    the way, and no apparent way to both of them - how to choose? </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Pandora's Box </h1>

    <p>Somebody has tinkered with Things Man Ought Not, or opened
    a portal to the Mean People Dimension, cracked a wall at the state prison,
    or summoned an ancient Babylonian god into a penthouse. Before the PCs
    can even think of confronting the source of the trouble, they must deal
    with the waves of trouble already released by it: monsters, old foes out
    for vengeance, curious aliens who think cars/citizens/McDonald's hamburgers
    resemble food, and so forth.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs can't simply take the released badness to the mat;
    they have to collect it and shove it back into the source before it the
    adventure can really end. The PCs are drawn in to the source and must solve
    problems on the other side before returning to this one. A secret book,
    code, or other rare element is necessary to plug the breach (maybe just
    the fellow who opened it). A close cousin to this plot is the basic "somebody
    has traveled into the past and messed with our reality" story. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Quest For the Sparkly Hoozits </h1>

    <p>Somebody needs a dingus (to fulfill a prophecy, heal the
    monarch, prevent a war, cure a disease, or what have you). The PCs must
    find a dingus. Often an old dingus, a mysterious dingus, and a powerful
    dingus. The PCs must learn more about it to track it down, and then deal
    with taking it from wherever it is.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The dingus is incomplete when found (one of the most irritating
    and un-fun plot twists in the universe). Somebody already owns it (or recently
    stole it, sometimes with legitimate claim or cause). The dingus is information,
    or an idea, or a substance, not a specific dingus. The PCs must "go
    undercover" or otherwise infiltrate a group or society, gaining the
    dingus by guile or stealth. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Recent Ruins </h1>

    <p>A town, castle, starship, outpost, or other civilized
    construct is lying in ruins. Very recently, it was just dandy. The PCs
    must enter the ruins, explore them, and find out what happened.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>Whatever ruined the ruins (including mean people, weird
    radiation, monsters, a new race, ghosts) is still a threat; the PCs must
    save the day. The inhabitants destroyed themselves. The "ruins"
    are a derelict ship or spaceship, recently discovered. The "ruin"
    is a ghost town, stumbled across as the PCs travel - but the map says the
    town is alive and well. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Running the Gauntlet </h1>

    <p>The PCs must travel through a hazardous area, and get
    through without being killed, robbed, humiliated, debased, diseased, or
    educated by whatever is there. The troubles they encounter are rarely personal
    in nature - the place <em>itself </em>is the "villain" of the adventure.
    </p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The place isn't dangerous at all, and the various "dangers"
    are actually attempts to communicate with the party by some agent or another.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Safari </h1>

    <p>The PCs are on a hunting expedition, to capture or kill
    and elusive and prized creature. They must deal with its environment, its
    own ability to evade them, and possibly its ability to fight them.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The creature is immune to their devices and weapons. There
    are other people actively protecting the creature. The creature's lair
    allows the PCs to stumble onto another adventure. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Score One for the Home Team </h1>

    <p>The PCs are participants in a race, contest, tournament,
    scavenger hunt or other voluntary bit of sport. They must win.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The other contestants are less honest, and the PCs must
    overcome their attempts to win dishonestly. The PCs are competing for a
    deeper purpose than victory, such as to keep another contestant safe, or
    spy on one, or just to get into the place where the event goes down. The
    PCs don't wish to win; they just wish to prevent the villain from winning.
    The event is a deliberate test of the PCs abilities (for entry into an
    organization, for example). The event becomes more deadly than it's supposed
    to. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Stalag 23 </h1>

    <p>The PCs are imprisoned, and must engineer an escape, overcoming
    any guards, automatic measures, and geographic isolation their prison imposes
    on them.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>Something has happened in the outside world and the prison
    security has fallen lax because of it. The PCs have been hired to "test"
    the prison - they aren't normal inmates. Other prisoners decide to blow
    the whistle for spite or revenge. The PCs are undercover to spy on a prisoner,
    but are then mistaken for real inmates and kept incarcerated. The PCs must
    escape on a tight schedule to get to another adventure outside the walls.

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Take Us To Memphis And Don't Slow
    Down </h1>

    <p>The PCs are on board a populated conveyance (East Indiaman,
    Cruise Ship, Ferry, Sleeper Starship), when it is hijacked. The PCs must
    take action while the normals sit and twiddle.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The "hijackers" are government agents pulling
    a complicated caper, forcing the PCs to choose sides. The hijackers don't
    realize there is a secondary danger that must be dealt with, and any attempt
    to convince them is viewed as a trick. The normals are unhelpful or even
    hostile to the PCs because they think the PCs are just making matters worse.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Troublemakers </h1>

    <p>A bad guy (or a group of them, or multiple parties) is
    kicking up a ruckus, upsetting the neighbors, poisoning the reservoirs,
    or otherwise causing trouble. The PCs have to go where the trouble is,
    locate the bad guys, and stop the party.</p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs must not harm the perpetrator(s); they must be bagged
    alive and well. The bad guys have prepared something dangerous and hidden
    as "insurance" if they are captured. The "bad guy"
    is a monster or dangerous animal (or an intelligent creature that everybody
    thinks is a monster or animal). The "bad guy" is a respected
    public figure, superior officer, or someone else abusing their authority,
    and the PCs might meet hostility from normally-helpful quarters who don't
    accept that the bad guy is bad. A balance of power perpetuates the trouble,
    and the PCs must choose sides to tip the balance and fix things. The "trouble"
    is diplomatic or political, and the PCs must make peace, not war. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>Uncharted Waters </h1>

    <p>The PCs are explorers, and their goal is to enter an unknown
    territory and scope it out. Naturally, the job isn't just going to be surveying
    and drawing sketches of local fauna; something is there, something fascinating
    and threatening. </p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>Either the place itself is threatening (in which case the
    PCs must both play National Geographic and simultaneously try to escape
    with their skin, sanity, and credit rating) or the place itself is very
    valuable and wonderful, and something <em>else </em>there is keen on making
    sure the PCs don't let anyone else know. Other potential conflicts involve
    damage to the PCs' conveyance or communication equipment, in which case
    this becomes Don't Eat the Purple Ones. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="trope">
    <h1>We're On The Outside Looking In
    </h1>

    <p>Any of the basic plots in this list can be reengineered
    with the PCs on the outside of it. Either the PCs are accompanying other
    characters in the midst of such a plot (often being called on to defend
    the plot from the outside, as it were), or they are minding their own business
    when the others involved in the plot show up, and must pick sides or simply
    resist. For instance, with Any Old Port In The Storm, the PCs could already
    be enjoying (or native to) the shelter when a strange group arrives. If
    the "the PCs are unwelcome" variant is employed, then perhaps
    the PCs will be the only voice of reason to still the religious fervor,
    racial prejudice, anti-monster sentiment, or whatever else is the source
    of conflict. </p>
    <p> <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes:
    </em>The PCs find themselves on the receiving end of the adventure.
    Take any of the plots here and reverse them, placing the PCs in the position
    where NPCs (often the villain, fugitive, etcetera) normally are. Instead
    of hunting, they must be hunted. Instead of fixing, they must avoid getting
    "fixed" themselves (ow). Alternately, leave a classic plot intact
    but turn the <em>twists </em>upside down, making them twistier (or refreshingly
    <em>un </em>twisty). </p>

  <h1>Tips and Tricks </h1>

  <p><em>Surrender yourself to metaphor.
  </em>I've written the plots in the language of (typically very
  physical) action-adventure genres, because that's the basic form of roleplaying
  adventure - but if you're playing on more levels than that, the list can
  still punch its weight. Just remember that every thing, place, and foe
  can <em>really </em>be a piece of information, person, and unhealthy attitude,
  as surely as a space station can be a dungeon and a magical residue can
  be a fingerprint. </p>

  <p><em>Double up. </em>A
  nice basic method is the chameleon game, where an adventure presents itself
  as one type of story in the "hook layer" but reveals itself as
  something else. Sometimes, the switch is innocent and natural - <em>Don't
  Eat the Purple Ones</em>, for example, makes a good hook for <em>Running
  the Gauntlet</em>, and <em>Most Peculiar, Momma </em>is a logical lead for
  <em>Pandora's Box</em>. Sometimes, the switch is something more sinister
  or deliberate, with NPCs selling the adventure as one thing when it's really
  another. This can <em>still </em>be innocent, in its way, if the NPCs have
  been duped themselves, or if they're just desperate for help and worried
  that nobody will be eager to tackle the <em>real </em>problem. </p>

  <p><em>Throw yourself a curve. </em>Your
  players will, anyway, so practice early. Pick two random entries from the
  Big List and make your adventure on those, no matter what comes up - the
  first one is the hook layer; the second is the meat of the adventure. If
  the same entry comes up both times, go with it! Two layers can have a similar
  structure but very different roots or details. </p>

  <p><em>Double up, part two: </em>Some
  very satisfying adventures weave two separate (or thematically-related)
  plots together. An easy way to make this work is to make one plot <em>physical
  </em>and the other plot <em>personal. </em>That way just one of the plots
  puts demand on the PCs' location, while the other one can tag along anywhere.
  For example: the PCs are hired to escort a prince to a summit so he can
  appear before the masses and end a war (a physical and simple example of
  Escort Service), but on the way, they realize that the poor guy is <em>suicidal
  </em>because state obligations have ruined his love life, and must prevent
  his self-destruction by either fixing the problem or convincing him to
  shoulder the burden (a personal and metaphorical example of Ounces of Prevention).
  </p>

  <p><em>Don't Panic. </em>A
  lot of GMs come to the Big List only once they've <em>begun </em>to panic.
  Don't crucify yourself just yet! In particular, don't fuss too much over
  plot, as many GMs do. All of the plots here can provide a tried-and-true,
  simple <em>structure</em>, and structure is <em>all </em>you need a plot for
  in a roleplaying game. Remember to play to the <em>strengths of the medium
  </em>- most all of which are about <em>character</em>, not plot. Only in an
  RPG can you experience a fictional character on a personal, first-hand
  level. Outline your adventures to make the most of that. Any plot that
  contains more than a basic structure is more likely to pull attention <em>away
  </em>from character, and that's burning the bridge for firewood. All you
  need to do is be ready to roll with the curves and have fun hamming it
  up. Relax. Game. </p>

  <p>And finally, here's <em>The Little
  List of Nearly-Universal Plot Twists That Work With Almost Any Plot Ever:
  </em>The PCs must work alongside an NPC or organization they'd
  rather not pal around with (those who are normally rivals or villains,
  or just a snooty expert sent along to "help" them, etc). The
  victims are really villains and the villains are really victims. The PCs
  meet others who can help them, but won't unless the PCs agree to help them
  with their own causes. The villain is somebody the PCs know personally,
  even respect or love (or someone they fall for, mid-story). The PCs must
  succeed without violence, or with special discretion. The PCs must succeed
  without access to powers, equipment, or other resources they're used to
  having. The villain is a recurring foil. Another group comparable to the
  PCs has already failed to succeed, and their bodies/equipment/etc provide
  clues to help the PCs do better. There are innocents nearby that the PCs
  must keep safe while dealing with the adventure. The adventure begins suddenly
  and without warning or buildup; the PCs are tossed into the fire of action
  in scene one. The PCs must pretend to be someone else, or pretend to be
  themselves but with very different allegiances, values or tastes. The PCs
  can't do everything and must choose: which evil to thwart? Which innocents
  to rescue? Which value or ideal to uphold? The PCs must make a personal
  sacrifice or others will suffer. The PCs aren't asked to <em>solve </em>the
  problem, just to render aid against a backdrop of larger trouble: get in
  a shipment of supplies, sneak out a patient that needs medical help, or
  so on. One of the PCs is (or is presumed to be) a lost heir, fulfillment
  of a prophecy, a volcano god, or some other savior and/or patsy, which
  is why the PCs must do whatever the adventure is about. There is another
  group of PC-like characters "competing" on the same adventure,
  possibly with very different goals for the outcome. </p>
