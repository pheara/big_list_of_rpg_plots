  <h1>The Big List of RPG Plots</h1>

What follows is a scrap of trivia . . . my collection
of <em>RPG plots</em>, in abstract form. I built this by examining
the premises of hundreds of published adventures for all systems (including
those systems dear and departed from print), trying to boil them down to
common denominators. The results are presented here: arbitrary, and sometimes
redundant. Nevertheless, I turn to this list when I'm stuck for a fresh
premise for next week's session of my campaign, whatever that campaign
might happen to be about at the time. It helps me keep from falling into
thematic ruts (my least favorite kind). With any luck, it might serve a
similar function for you.
<p><em>Note: </em>The "plots" are arranged in alphabetical
order by title. Since the titles are arbitrary, this serves no useful function
at all. And if you want shakespearean
five-act hoozits, plot trees, Man
Versus Himself and other Serious Literary Bunkum, try <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023309/http://www.writersdigest.com/">Writer's
Digest</a></em>. This ain't Oxford, baby. </p>

  <h1>Tips and Tricks </h1>

  <p><em>Surrender yourself to metaphor.
  </em>I've written the plots in the language of (typically very
  physical) action-adventure genres, because that's the basic form of roleplaying
  adventure - but if you're playing on more levels than that, the list can
  still punch its weight. Just remember that every thing, place, and foe
  can <em>really </em>be a piece of information, person, and unhealthy attitude,
  as surely as a space station can be a dungeon and a magical residue can
  be a fingerprint. </p>

  <p><em>Double up. </em>A
  nice basic method is the chameleon game, where an adventure presents itself
  as one type of story in the "hook layer" but reveals itself as
  something else. Sometimes, the switch is innocent and natural - <em>Don't
  Eat the Purple Ones</em>, for example, makes a good hook for <em>Running
  the Gauntlet</em>, and <em>Most Peculiar, Momma </em>is a logical lead for
  <em>Pandora's Box</em>. Sometimes, the switch is something more sinister
  or deliberate, with NPCs selling the adventure as one thing when it's really
  another. This can <em>still </em>be innocent, in its way, if the NPCs have
  been duped themselves, or if they're just desperate for help and worried
  that nobody will be eager to tackle the <em>real </em>problem. </p>

  <p><em>Throw yourself a curve. </em>Your
  players will, anyway, so practice early. Pick two random entries from the
  Big List and make your adventure on those, no matter what comes up - the
  first one is the hook layer; the second is the meat of the adventure. If
  the same entry comes up both times, go with it! Two layers can have a similar
  structure but very different roots or details. </p>

  <p><em>Double up, part two: </em>Some
  very satisfying adventures weave two separate (or thematically-related)
  plots together. An easy way to make this work is to make one plot <em>physical
  </em>and the other plot <em>personal. </em>That way just one of the plots
  puts demand on the PCs' location, while the other one can tag along anywhere.
  For example: the PCs are hired to escort a prince to a summit so he can
  appear before the masses and end a war (a physical and simple example of
  Escort Service), but on the way, they realize that the poor guy is <em>suicidal
  </em>because state obligations have ruined his love life, and must prevent
  his self-destruction by either fixing the problem or convincing him to
  shoulder the burden (a personal and metaphorical example of Ounces of Prevention).
  </p>

  <p><em>Don't Panic. </em>A
  lot of GMs come to the Big List only once they've <em>begun </em>to panic.
  Don't crucify yourself just yet! In particular, don't fuss too much over
  plot, as many GMs do. All of the plots here can provide a tried-and-true,
  simple <em>structure</em>, and structure is <em>all </em>you need a plot for
  in a roleplaying game. Remember to play to the <em>strengths of the medium
  </em>- most all of which are about <em>character</em>, not plot. Only in an
  RPG can you experience a fictional character on a personal, first-hand
  level. Outline your adventures to make the most of that. Any plot that
  contains more than a basic structure is more likely to pull attention <em>away
  </em>from character, and that's burning the bridge for firewood. All you
  need to do is be ready to roll with the curves and have fun hamming it
  up. Relax. Game. </p>

  <p>And finally, here's <em>The Little
  List of Nearly-Universal Plot Twists That Work With Almost Any Plot Ever:
  </em>The PCs must work alongside an NPC or organization they'd
  rather not pal around with (those who are normally rivals or villains,
  or just a snooty expert sent along to "help" them, etc). The
  victims are really villains and the villains are really victims. The PCs
  meet others who can help them, but won't unless the PCs agree to help them
  with their own causes. The villain is somebody the PCs know personally,
  even respect or love (or someone they fall for, mid-story). The PCs must
  succeed without violence, or with special discretion. The PCs must succeed
  without access to powers, equipment, or other resources they're used to
  having. The villain is a recurring foil. Another group comparable to the
  PCs has already failed to succeed, and their bodies/equipment/etc provide
  clues to help the PCs do better. There are innocents nearby that the PCs
  must keep safe while dealing with the adventure. The adventure begins suddenly
  and without warning or buildup; the PCs are tossed into the fire of action
  in scene one. The PCs must pretend to be someone else, or pretend to be
  themselves but with very different allegiances, values or tastes. The PCs
  can't do everything and must choose: which evil to thwart? Which innocents
  to rescue? Which value or ideal to uphold? The PCs must make a personal
  sacrifice or others will suffer. The PCs aren't asked to <em>solve </em>the
  problem, just to render aid against a backdrop of larger trouble: get in
  a shipment of supplies, sneak out a patient that needs medical help, or
  so on. One of the PCs is (or is presumed to be) a lost heir, fulfillment
  of a prophecy, a volcano god, or some other savior and/or patsy, which
  is why the PCs must do whatever the adventure is about. There is another
  group of PC-like characters "competing" on the same adventure,
  possibly with very different goals for the outcome. </p>
